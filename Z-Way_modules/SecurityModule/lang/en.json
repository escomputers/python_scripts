    "m_descr": "The security module enables the implementation of a classic security system.<br/>If one of the selected triggering devices is activated, a silent alarm is triggered first. This can be configured as required to generate notifications via e-mail or push, for example. If the silent alarm is not acknowledged by resetting the security module, the system triggers the alarm after a definable interval. The actions to be performed can be configured accordingly.<br/><br/><h3>Configuarion</h3><strong>Triggering devices</strong> <br/><ul><li>First select the sensors that can trigger an alarm. Use the button <i class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign'></i> and <i class='glyphicon glyphicon-minus-sign'></i> to add another entry or to delete an existing entry.</li><li>For each device, you can define which status must occur for the alarm to be triggered.</li></ul> <strong>Event - Silent alarm | Alarm </strong> <br/><ul><li>Now select the devices or scenes that are triggered as soon as an alarm is triggered.</li><li>In addition, you have the option of defining an individual notification by e-mail or push message.</li></ul> <strong>Event - Arming | Disarming | Reset</strong> <br/><ul><li>It is also possible to activate devices or scenes as soon as the state of the safety module changes.</li><li>Here, too, an individual notification by e-mail or push message can be defined.</li></ul><strong>External control </strong> <br /><ul><li>The state of the security module can be changed via the UI and external devices.</li><li>To do this, select the devices and the status that the security module switches on or off or resets.</li><li>Note that an incorrect configuration can lead to undefined behavior of the security module.</li></ul><strong>Advanced settings</strong> <br /><ul><li>Select the time to wait before arming.</li><li>Select the interval at which the alarm event is to be repeated.</li><li>Set the duration of the silent alarm.</li><li>You also have the option of controlling the module using a schedule. To do this, select the appropriate days and the time from which the selected status is to be activated.</li></ul><h3>Widget</h3> After successful configuration, the module generates an independent widget, which allows control of the module via 3 buttons.
